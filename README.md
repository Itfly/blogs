Welcome to my blog repo. I find it quite convenient to create blog content from here. Some blogs get posted to my blog spaces on other websites, but few remain here simply because not everything can be published in China. If you are interested in knowing what I do, please check out my [LinkedIn profile](https://cn.linkedin.com/in/martincai).

Available blogs are:
* **[双 Azure 虚机翻墙](https://github.com/martincai/blogs/blob/master/azure-2vm-ssh.md)** - This blog was written in Chinese. It talked about leveraging two Azure VMs (one in China, the other elsewhere) to "jump over" the Great Firewall of China via SSH tunneling. Of course, the same can be done on top of other cloud service providers.
* **[OpenWrt + OpenVPN + Azure = 会翻墙的路由器](https://github.com/martincai/blogs/blob/master/openwrt%2Bopenvpn%2Bazure.md)** - This blog was written in Chinese. It talked about customizing your home router using OpenWrt system in China to achieve an ultimate out-of-the-wall experience for all connected devices. No need to set up each device individually.
- **[树莓派变身翻墙服务器](https://github.com/martincai/blogs/blob/master/raspberrypi-azure-ssh.md)** - This blog was written in Chinese. For those who no longer have a PC or laptop at home and only use iPhone/iPad devices, this blog might interest you. Instead of hacking your router to run OpenWrt, get a Raspberry Pi toy and configure it to serve as SOCKS5 proxy for your iPhone/iPad.
